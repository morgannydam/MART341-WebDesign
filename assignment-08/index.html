      <pre>Blue-jean baby
L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed
Pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina
You must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me
Always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks
Out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back
She just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man
He makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on
She sings the songs
The words she knows
The tune she hums
But oh, how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Blue-jean baby
L.A. Lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed
Pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina
You must have seen her
Dancing in the sand
Now she's in me
Always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Oh, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today</pre>
