  <p>
“i want to apologize to all the women <br>
 i have called pretty. <br>
before i’ve called them intelligent or brave. <br>
i am sorry i made it sound as though <br>
something as simple as what you’re born with <br>
is all you have to be proud of <br>
when your spirit has crushed mountains <br>
from now on i will say things like you are resilient <br>
or, you are extraordinary <br>
not because i don’t think you’re pretty. <br>
but because you are so much more than that” <br>
