For this assignment, learning how to begin styling certain aspects of the page was new and interesting to learn for me. I am excited to continue learning how to stylize the page in general, but there is nothing specific I am anxious about. This week's assignment had me stumped when trying to section my page with divs, but turns out I was just missing the "#" in my coding. This was an easy fix once I figured it out!
